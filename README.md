# SoloAbyss

**SoloAbyss** is a terminal-based, single-player dungeon crawler implemented in C++. The game features an endless tower structure with procedurally generated floors, turn-based combat, and support for modular gameplay extensions such as a dynamic weather system and a quest engine. It was developed to demonstrate object-oriented design principles, memory-safe architecture, and feature extensibility.

## Features

- **Endless Tower Progression**: Procedural generation of rooms, potions, enemies, and loot on each floor.
- **Race-Based Playstyles**: Players choose a character race with unique base attributes and passive effects.
- **Turn-Based Mechanics**: Game state updates upon each valid player command, ensuring deterministic behavior.
- **Potion System**: Potions have hidden effects until first use; some classes gain special interactions.
- **Combat Engine**: Includes dynamic enemy AI, factional hostility logic, and damage calculations.
- **Gold & Loot System**: Diverse treasure types with faction-specific effects (e.g., Orcs collect half gold).
- **Dynamic Weather (Optional)**: Adds environmental effects that impact visibility and movement.
- **Quest System (Optional)**: Supports side quests with reward structures and objective tracking.
